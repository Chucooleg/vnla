To download data, run

```
$ bash download.sh
```

The script will download a file named `vnla_data.zip` and unzip it into two dataset directories, `asknav` and `noroom`. 
It will also download the precomputed image embeddings computed by ResNet pretrained on ImageNet. 
Please read our paper for more detail about each dataset.
